# TDXLib (TeamDynamix Python SDK)

TDXLib is a suite of Python libraries originally designed to take input from Google Sheets and create tickets in [TeamDynamix](https://teamdynamix.com) based on the contents of the sheets. The scope of the project has broadened past its humble beginnings, and continues to do so whenever there's a feature we need that it doesn't currently support.

## Dependencies

### Required: 
* Python 3.6+
* requests
* python-dateutil
* pyjwt

## Quick-Start Guide

### Installation

1. [Download](https://www.python.org/) and install Python 3.6 or later. If you're new to Python, check out this [setup tutorial](https://realpython.com/installing-python/ "Python 3 Installation & Setup Guide"). For an introduction to basic Python syntax and use, check out the guides on [python.org](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/) 

   _NOTE: although Python comes pre-installed on MacOS and many GNU/Linux systems, it's often version 2.7. For GNU/Linux, install python3 packages if available. For MacOS, check out [homebrew](brew.sh)._

2. **OPTION 1:** (Stable Release)
   
   Install via [pip](https://pypi.org) using the following command:
   
         pip install tdxlib
       
   This command will install any other required packages automatically.
   
   _Note: if you installed python3 packages, the Python v3 Pip may be called using ```pip3```_
   
   **OPTION 2:** (Latest Code)
   
   1. Clone or download TDXLib from [GitHub](https://github.com/cedarville-university/tdxlib).
   
      _NOTE: If you use Option 2, the root folder of the repository will need to be your scripts' working directory so you can import TDXLib without making changes to your ```PYTHONPATH``` variable_

   2. Install the required dependencies to your environment using `pip`, which is bundled with Python 3.4+. If you run into issues on Windows, be sure that the location of your Python installation is specified in your system's `PATH` variable.

      The necessary packages are specified in `requirements.txt` and can be installed with `pip` 
    
      If your OS comes with Python 2.7, use `pip3` or whatever the name of the Python 3.6+ pip binary is on your system. A [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) can be helpful here:

          pip install -r requirements.txt

      Alternatively, install all the packages manually:

          pip install requests python-dateutil
    
      To get the libraries necessary to work with Google Sheets (as in the [sample script](examples/example_ticket_generation.py)), you can also install them with `pip`:
        
          pip install gspread oauth2client

### Making a TDXlib integration object

4. Start a Python console:  
        
       python
       
5. Import TDXLib into your scripting environment:

       import tdxlib
    
6. To interact with the TDX API, you'll need to create an api integration object, through which all of the TDXLib commands are run. TDXLib currently supports three types of integrations:

   * **TDX Ticket Integration (Tickets, Ticket Tasks, etc.)**
   
         my_tdx_integration = tdxlib.tdx_ticket_integration.TDXTicketIntegration()

   * **TDX Asset Integration (Assets, CIs, etc.)**
         
         my_tdx_asset_integration = tdxlib.tdx_asset_integration.TDXAssetIntegration()

   * **TDX Client Portal Integration (Knowledge Base Articles, Services, etc.)**
         
         my_tdx_client_portal_integration = tdxlib.tdx_client_portal_integration.TDXClientPortalIntegration()

7. In order to store settings, TDXLib uses a INI-style configuration file. 
   If there is no file set up in your working directory, TDXLib will walk you through the generation of one the first time you instantiate an integration object:
  
      <pre>
        $ python
        Python 3.7.3 (...) [...] on [...]
        Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
        >>> <b>import tdxlib</b>
        >>> <b>tdx = tdxlib.tdx_ticket_integration.TDXTicketIntegration()</b>
        No configuration file found. Please enter the following information:
        
        Please enter your TeamDynamix organization name.
        This is the teamdynamix.com subdomain that you use to access TeamDynamix. 
        Alternatively, enter the fully qualified DNS name of your TDX instance:
        Organization Name/FQDN ({orgname}.teamdynamix.com/{orgname}.university.edu): <b>myuniversity</b>
        
        Use Sandbox? [Y/N]: <b>yes</b>
        
        TDX API Username (tdxuser@orgname.com): <b>myuser@myuniversity.edu</b>
        
        TDXLib can store the password for the API user in the configuration file.
        This is convenient, but not very secure.
        Store password for myuser@myuniversity.edu? [Y/N]: <b>no</b>
        
        Tickets App ID (optional): <b>123</b>
        
        Assets App ID (optional): <b>456</b>
        
        TDXLib uses (mostly) intelligent caching to speed up API calls on repetitive operations.
        In very dynamic environments, TDXLib's caching can cause issues.
        Disable Caching? [Y/N]: <b>no</b>
        
        Initial settings saved to: tdxlib.ini
       </pre>

    The generated file will look something like this:

        [TDX API Settings]
        'org_name': 'myuniversity',
        'full_host': 'its.myuniversity.edu',
        'sandbox': True,
        'username': 'myuser@university.edu',
        'password': 'Prompt',
        'ticket_app_id': '123',
        'asset_app_id': '456',
        'caching': True,
        'log_level': 'ERROR'
     
    * The `org_name` field is whatever subdomain your organization uses to access TeamDynamix. For example, `https://myuniversity.teamdynamix.com`.

    * The `sandbox` field specifies whether TDXLib should interact with a sandbox version of the TDX Environment, which is written over by production monthly. It is recommended to use the sandbox environment when first getting familiar with the API environment.

    * The `username` and `password` fields are the login credentials for an account to be used with the TeamDynamix API. Many API endpoints (such as creating objects in TDX) require elevated permissions beyond the average user. You may need to create a user specifically for use with TDXLib and grant permissions based on what you need to do.
    
    * If the `password` field is set to `'Prompt'`, then whenever a new integration object is made, it will request a password, and dispose of the password after getting an API token: 
    
       <pre>Enter the TDX Password for user myuser@myuniversity.edu (this password will not be stored):   </pre>

    * The `ticket_app_id`, `asset_app_id`, and `client_portal_app_id` fields are the numbers that appear after `Apps` in your TeamDynamix URL, and are specific to your organization. You can find these ID's in the URLs in the following locations when using TDX apps through TDNext in your browser: 
    
      * Tickets: `https://myuniversity.teamdynamix.com/TDNext/Apps/{ticketAppId}/Tickets/...`  
      * Assets: `https://myuniversity.teamdynamix.com/TDNext/Apps/{assetAppId}/Assets/...`
      * Client Portal: `https://myuniversity.teamdynamix.com/TDNext/Apps/{clientPortalAppId}/KnowledgeBase/...`

    * The `caching` field specifies whether or not TDXLib should cache TeamDynamix objects such as valid ticket types, statuses and priorities. Setting this option to `True` reduces the volume of API calls and allows TDXLib to perform some batch operations much faster.
    
    * The `log_level` field specifies the python logging level that TDXLib will log at.

    * The `timezone` field specifies the timezone you'd like TDXLib to operate in. TDXLib will translate date/time objects from TeamDyanmix in UTC to this timezone.
    
  * You can optionally specify an alternative configuration file that TDXLib should search for in your working directory. By default, it will look for `tdxlib.ini`.

          >>> tdx = tdx_ticket_integration.TDXTicketIntegration("specialconfig.ini")

  * Depending on your `tdxlib.ini` settings, you may be prompted for a password to authenticate into the TeamDynamix API. Once everything is working, go ahead and test out a method:

          >>> accounts = tdx.get_all_accounts()

8. TDXLib can also be configured directly by a python dictionary. 

    Settings passed in as a dictionary are overwritten by any values in a filename (and if no file name is passed, the default configuration file, `tdxlib.ini` in the working directory)
   
    Use the following format for the dictionary configuration:
    <pre>
    config = {
         "org_name": "exampleorg",
         "sandbox": true,
         "auth_type": "password",
         "username": "someone@example.edu",
         "password": "a password",
         "ticket_app_id": 300,
         "asset_app_id": "",
         "caching": true,
         "timezone": "-0500",
         "log_level": "ERROR"
     }
    </pre>
    The only required settings in this are `org_name` and either `asset_app_id` or `ticket_app_id` if you're creating `TDXAssetIntegration` or `TDXTicketIntegration` objects. If you set `auth_type` to `password` a username is also required.
    Unset settings will be defaulted per the values in `tdxlib.tdx_constants.default_config`.
9. TDXLib can also be configured via Environment variables. Any values passed in via dictionary, from a file, or in the default configuration file (`tdxlib.ini` in the working directory) override any values passed in as environment variables. 

    Here's a sample of environment variables you can use (they are the same as the config values for dictionary config, but uppercase and prefixed with `TDXLIB_`): 
    <pre>
        export TDXLIB_ORG_NAME=exampleorg
        export TDXLIB_SANDBOX=true
        export TDXLIB_AUTH_TYPE=password
        export TDXLIB_USERNAME=someon@example.edu
        export TDXLIB_PASSWORD=mypassword
        export TDXLIB_TICKET_APP_ID=300
        export TDXLIB_ASSET_APP_ID=400
        export TDXLIB_CACHING=true
        export TDXLIB_TIMEZONE=-0500
        export TDXLIB_LOG_LEVEL=ERROR
   </pre>
